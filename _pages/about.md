Welcome to my web page!

I am an Assistant Professor (RtdA) of Statistical Science at the [Department of Economics, Social Studies, Applied Mathematics and Statistics (ESOMAS)](https://www.esomas-en.unito.it/do/home.pl) of the [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it). 

I am also a Research Affiliate at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org) as part of the ["de Castro" Statistics Initiative](https://www.carloalberto.org/research/statistics-initiative), a Research Affiliate at the [Bayes Lab](https://bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/) at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics (BIDSA)](https://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home) and a member of the Complex Data Modeling Research Network led by [MiDas](https://midas.mat.uc.cl/network).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Statistics at the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/) at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), under the mentorship of [Peter Müller](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/pmueller/) and [Abhra Sarkar](https://abhrastat.github.io/). 
I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home), under the supervision of [Antonio Lijoi](http://mypage.unibocconi.it/antoniolijoi/) and [Igor Prünster](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=187032&cognome=PRUENSTER&nome=IGOR&urlBackMy=).

## Research interests
I am interested in Bayesian modeling of complex data structures. More specifically I have been working on:

* **Bayesian nonparametrics**: discrete random probabilities, mixture models, random partitions and probabilistic clustering.

* **Bayesian modeling for binary and categorical data**: dynamic regression for binary time series, hidden Markov models, drift diffusion models and Bayesian categorical regression.

* **Probabilistic dimensionality reduction**: Bayesian multidimensional scaling and individual difference scaling analysis.

* **Computational statistics**:  Monte Carlo, Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo methods, variational inference and expectation propagation.

* **Applications**: auditory neuroscience, genomics and proteomics.
